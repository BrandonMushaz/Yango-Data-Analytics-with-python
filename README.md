# Yango-Data-Analytics-with-python
Data Analytics System:Case for Yango Drive Namibia 
A data-driven web system designed to optimize operations and maximize profits for Yango Drive Namibia. Combines Jupyter Notebook analytics with a PHP/HTML front-end, offering user/admin dashboards, login functionality, and simulated data insights on trips, revenue, and route performance.
Note: Dataset used is simulated to enable analysis and support data-driven decision-making in the absence of official data.
This project was carried out as part of my System Development Project and showcases how data analytics can improve decision-making in ride-hailing operations.
